        <center>YDU stands for the younger generation, and our policies reflect that!</center><br><br>

        <center><h2>Schooling</h2></center>
        <center>The YDU wants to create the post secondary education fund for underprivledged children, and create federal funds for the struggling public school system.
        </center><br>

        <center><h2>Healthcare</h2></center>
        <center>As students pay for university, and don't have benefits from a job, the YDU wants to provide universal pharmacare for all students.
            We also want to create hiring programs to inspire the next generation of doctors and nurses.
        </center><br>

        <center><h2>Environment</h2></center>
        <center>The YDU wants to keep our planet alive and thriving for the next generation, so we are purposing iniatives and systems, such as clean energy and increased tax rebates on electric vehicles, for a carbon net-zero economy by 2050.
            The YDU is aware of the detirment to oil workers this may cause, and will offer free training programs for them to transfer to the cleaner industry.
        </center><br>

        <center><h2>Economy</h2></center>
        <center>We want to create funds for developing efficiaent housing for the middle and lower class.
        </center><br>

        <center><h2>Natural Disasters</h2></center>
        <center>We will create hiring programs for forest fire fighters, pilots, and jobs in that industry so we can further protect our communities.
            A national fund for water bombers and other advanced fire fighting equipment will be created.
        </center><br>

        <center><h2>Pipelines</h2></center>
        <center>Though we do not support the Trans Mountain Pipeline, we will not cancel the project, and it will be slowly fazed out as clean renewable energy becomes the new norm.
